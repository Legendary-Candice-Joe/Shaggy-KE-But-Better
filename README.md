# The shaggy mod source code

This is the shaggy mod. But I made a few changes so you don't hate the old kade engine version.

psych engine version is better. use that one.

# wtf! why???

well you see, the kade eninge version is full of bugs from crappy input, to... other things. as well as also having bad design choices like bad and optimized code, weird key binds, weird charting, and so on.

WELL NOT ANYMORE!! with the sheer power of my stupidity, I have gone in to the code and made a few key changes like, updating the note assets, optimizing code, fixing 9K keybinds to be standard, updating charts, and even adding a few touches like hold note on downscroll are not stupid, and shaggys strums now glow, and most importantly: THE INPUT SYSTEM IS DECENT (with custom input).

This is a new way to experience a legacy version of the mod :)
